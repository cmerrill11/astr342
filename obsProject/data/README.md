### Data Repository
The purpose of this repository is to store all of the data that I need for ASTR480 and any other class. The reason for it is so that it can easily be put onto a desktop or laptop, saved to this repo, and then cloned onto another server!

If someone has a better way of moving data directly onto the server, I would be happy to embrace that method.
